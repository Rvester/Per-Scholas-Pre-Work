         <p class="twopara">The picture above represents my hardships of 2022</p>
         <br>
         <p id="firstpara">I was born in Barbados and moved to Brooklyn, New York, when I was only 4 years old.
             I grew up in Brooklyn until I was the age of 19 and moved to New Jersey. Since I was a
             small child I have always been interested in technology, my parents got me my first computer
             since I was 6 years old and I loved it.</p>

    <div id="div4">
        <p class="secondpara">
            I learned so much by trial and error it really helped
            me establish what I want to do as I got older, it only took me so long to realize that the
            time to act is now. I am now 24 and I have always been more on the hardware side.
            I have built over 5-6 rigs throughout my teenage years and have gotten better each time.
            I got into coding around the age of 20 and always practiced on and off but then realized I could
            really make a thriving career out of this, I find coding to be really enjoyable and I like to aspect
            of always learning since the tech field will never stop growing. 
            Here are some things I really enjoy.
