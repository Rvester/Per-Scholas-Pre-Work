    <p id="Page1para">I have many hobbies as of right now, such as playing football, videogames, drawing, and sleeping.
       My favorite thing of all is spending quality time with the love of my life, one interesting thing about me is that I heal unnaturally fast for some reason,
       when I was younger around the age of 14 I had a big gash in my big toe, like it almost came off type of big and after
       cleaning and wrapping it, the wound healed within like two weeks. My FAVORITE show right now has to be Vox Machina on Prime.
       It has been a really long time since I enjoyed a show this much and is definitely in my top 3 of all time right now and if you
       are a big fan of Dungeons and Dragon's with an adult comedic twist then you will love this show too.
